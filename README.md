# 🏒 Mora9 Hockey Event - Points Table

I am happy to publish this with you! This project showcases the preview points table of the matches for Mora9's hockey event (Boys and Girls Inter-University) organized by the University of Moratuwa. This includes:

- 📋 **Hockey Teams** (Women's and Men's) categorized into Team A, Team B, etc.
- 📊 **Points Table Calculation**: Displaying all data related to match points and automatically calculating the points based on match results.
- 📜 **Match History**: You can also view the history of past matches for reference.

## 🔨 How It Works

- All the data is managed via simple `.xlsx` files located in the `src/data_Sheets/` directory.
- Whenever you want to update the points table or match history, simply modify the relevant `.xlsx` files, and the changes will reflect on the website.

## 📁 Data Structure

The data is organized as follows:
```
src/
│
├── data_Sheets/

│
├── Images/
├── Scripts/
|__ Index.html
|__pointtable_boys.html
|__pointtable_girls.html

```

## 🚀 Features
